# Chemical Reaction in a Reactor (Plug Flow Reactor)

This repository contains both analytical and numerical solutions to a chemical reaction model in a Plug Flow Reactor (PFR), based on the exercise described in Section 1.2.1 of the reference textbook [KX].

### Contents
	•	Chemical Reaction in a React.py: Python implementation solving the PFR model numerically and visualizing the results.
	•	Chemical reaction in a reactor.pdf: Detailed write-up with the analytical derivation, dimensional analysis, and graphical comparison between analytical and numerical solutions.
